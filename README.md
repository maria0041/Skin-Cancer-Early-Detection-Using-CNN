## Overview

This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect skin cancer from dermoscopic images.  Trained on the ISIC 2024 Skin Cancer Detection Challenge dataset, the model classifies skin lesions as benign or malignant. The results show that CNNs can learn complex image features and generalize well, highlighting their potential for improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.

## Key Findings

*   **High Accuracy:** 88.55% accuracy in classifying skin lesions.
*   **Deep Learning for Diagnosis:** Reduces subjectivity and variability in human diagnosis, potentially improving patient outcomes.
*   **Large-Scale Dataset:** Training on the ISIC 2024 dataset improved model generalization.
*   **Overfitting Challenges:**  Identified overfitting, suggesting a need for further regularization and data augmentation.
